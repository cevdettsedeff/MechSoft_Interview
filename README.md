## Project: "Meeting Organizer"
* In this repository, you can find the algorithm questions requested in the interview and the "Meeting Organizer" project. In the Backend part of the project, I developed a Web Api with .Net Core Onion Architecture. I used technologies such as Entity Framework, Repository Design Pattern, CQRS Design Pattern, Fluent Validation, AutoMapper and MedaitR. In the front-end part, I used Blazor Web Assembly. You can see screenshots of the project below.

## Algorithm Questions in Python
* **size_multiply_with_occurence:** From all possible substrings in a given string, obtain the substring and score that gives the maximum *"string length * frequency"* score in the main text.
* **reverse_some_parts:** It is known that in a text where some words are written backwards, the words in parentheses are written correctly. Correct both these parentheses and the reverse words to get the correct output.
